Once upon a time there was a boy named Devin_Shnevin_21. As you may have figured, his name was Devin and he is me. This
boy had a friend named Baseballrox77. As you may have figured as with my name, Baseballrox77 sucked at MLB the Show 19.  
Devin_Shnevin_21 would cream him every time. Then Baseball's brother, Darth_Yoda_1212, was crushed brutally by a
 chandelier to his death.


In case you were wondering, Baseballrox77 is Apar, and he does suck. He is pathetically bad.

-His brother, Darth_Yoda_1212, is a person named Akash and he had a VERY brutal death.
