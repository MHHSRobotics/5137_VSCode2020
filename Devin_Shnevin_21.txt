Once upon a time there was a boy named Devin_Shnevin_21. As you may have figured, his real name was Devin and he was really bad at
everything from videogames to sports to school. This boy had a friend named Timothy. As you may have figured as with his name, Timothy was
the polar oposite of Devin_Shnevin_21, and was amazing at everything.They would play each other in MLB The Show 19 and Devin_Shnevin_21
would get creamed by Timothy every time-it was not even close. Then, Timothy's brother, DarthYoda1212, was crushed brutally by a chandelier
due to his own stupidity, and died.
As you may have already figured out, Timothy is Apar, and DarthYoda1212 is his brother Akash, who had a VERY brutal death.

So, Devin, you thought I wouldn't notice, huh? You think I'm trash at life, since my user name is indeed DarthYoda1212. Alas, you have but only mercy from me, as if I compete
against you, you would sorely lose. Anyways, how's it going in life? Are the kids treating you well? Lol. ;)
